## Introduction
This vignette aims to provide a quick introduction to morphometric analyses and the comparison of methods on coral reef fish.  It was created based on R version 4.0.2 and Momocs version 1.3.2.

It is the companion tutorial for the published paper:

Quitzau, M., Frelat, R., Bonhomme, V., Möllmann, C., Nagelkerke, L., & Bejarano, S. (2022). Traits, landmarks and outlines: Three congruent sides of a tale on coral reef fish morphology. Ecology and Evolution, 12, e8787. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8787.

See the “Material and Methods” section of the paper and the “Electronic supplementary materials” for more details about the method.
